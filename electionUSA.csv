Wow!! That hit me in my feelings😢 What an amazing first speech. I haven't watched a single debate or interviews through the whole election. Heard all the talk about how Biden can't finish a thought, or sentence. He's lost his mind, early onset of Alzheimer's. That made me want to love and be proud to be an American.. And I'm usually the first to dog the way this country and it's many wonderful different races has become.. This made me hopeful for our future as humans and to hold my head high and be proud to be a free American in this huge beautiful country of ours🤯💯✌️

Why should we be proud in this world where we are not sure if we will wake up in the morning?  Everyone can hurt our body.  But only a group of people can hurt our feelings for those we love as much as we love life.  So some worries need to be erased, some quarrels need to be resolved, some misconceptions need to be changed.

President elect Biden is forged with deeply painful life tragedies and rich political experiences in preparation to his toughest battle in leading a divided and fractured nation.

Reading his life story, I cannot help myself remembering the tiny book Profiles in Courage by JFK I read long ago. I imagine myself travelling back in time and find him amongst great leaders of not so distant past. Mr President, I have no doubt that the whole universe has conspired to help and put you in your exact place and cirscumstance.

The story of how Biden and Poroshenko for a billion dollars from Joe Biden fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who began to investigate the son of Joe Biden, hunter Biden, the youngest son of us Vice President Joe Biden, became a member of the Board of Directors of Burisma in April 2014 (it also included former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, a friend of the stepson of former Secretary of state John Kerry Devon Archer, and others). ... As part of the investigation into possible money laundering, the British authorities froze deposits in London banks for $23 million, which allegedly belonged to the owner of Burisma Zlochevsky. In Ukraine, a new scandal, and surprisingly not coronavirus. This week, the world finally saw and heard the documentary ... We found out who exactly and what Poroshenko paid a billion dollars for-this is Joe Biden and the entire Obama army.

I appreciate the fact that he wants to move forward and bring us all together as Americans, No separations , No red vs. Blue just Americans! No leaving anyone out! This is what we need, Even with anything he said wrong or came off wrong in the past, I am willing to give Biden a chance before Trump anyday🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 A leader is not about being perfect, A leader is someone who has realized their mistakes however Know their potential to become greater and become that over time. Someone like Biden , Is the prefect example of that! He stands for morals, Leadership of his family and not just America and other countries. This man has standards and Determination! He learned a lot from Obama when he was vice president as well! The level of respect this man has earned, He has our full support!  Cant wait to witness greatness and meaningful effective changes Trump could never !!

And he said to God in his wise saying, and those who were killed for the sake of God do not count dead, but rather they are alive with their Lord and give to God. Every Muslim who defended his land, his family and his homeland says, we preach to him of his paradise. Judgment is not for you, the ruling is for God alone, there is no partner to him, so you belong to God who created you, and to God who kills you, but God will remain alive, and you are in the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

Not the president-elect. Not the new president.  I don't think Gore even gave a speech so fast.   Maybe if Biden and Harris act like they won no one would notice that they didn't win.  Honest president-elect NOT.

You need to check out Dominion. This is the manufacturer of the computer on line counting machines in DEMOCRAT states. No they do not all use the same machines. But almost to a man democrat states use Dominion kit.  The big scam is, this company is owned by and run by family members of the most senior Democrats in the USA. The CEO is husband to the most senior Democrat.  (Google and Wikki fill in the blanks quite well) The shares are all owned by democrats. It was a Dominion machine that was  nudged into a quick transfer of votes, once discovered the cover story was ""Glitch"" however no one has any idea the true scale of the fraud ...  yet questions need answering. But first the why?  Well once you set off on the path of fraud you may as well do a good job. In the past basic fraud lead to 115% turn outs and more. So an issue. This lead to more covert sophistication. Live data. This then gave the ""thieves"" access to the numbers,  telling them how far behind they were, and more importantly how many votes  were needed without the alarm bells sounding fraud. .(the 115% issue)  This had to be carefully factored to avoid another 115% turn out issue.  You then need to plan how to collect and introduce additional ballots. Its starts back in May the cover story. You tell everyone on your side to use mail in voting because of fears of COVID 19. This was massively convenient and pushed by a compliant press. You argue and win publically a massive increase in mail in ballot voting. Next on election day via the live data feed (you made the machines and you get the data) someone calculates which states need an injection of ballots and how many..  These then are found. Don't forget the cover story is the post office is over whelmed and some will arrive late but all is well because of the post mark being proof of posting within the voting time limit. So the excuse is circulating before the event. Next you make sure any witnesses are kept well away from the vote counting and accept a little push back on this,  but none from the media of course. Then just in time hundreds of thousands of votes appear and save the day. Yet there are safe guards built into the ballot counting process to prevent fraud. That is the automatic signature comparison algorithm. The authenticated threshold is dumbed down from a 75 % probable match to a worthless 40%  Done without anyone knowing.    Then turning down the dot per inch resolution from the workable 200 DPI to 50 DPI ... The system then can never find fault with a signature. So all doubtful ballots even if signed by Donald Duck are accepted as valid.  This has added benefits. The election is close and believable !!!    Recently (yesterday) an affidavit from a postal worker surfaced, he was working on back dating ballots for that nights find. Then a Judge today confesses he was bribed back in May... He does not say quite what for. But it's nice if something is contested to have the judge on your side.  Next an honest judge insists by court order ""observers"" are allowed within 6 feet of the vote counters, this is ignored completely despite it being state law. The illegal votes are safely introduced. Joe Biden and the media say Joe will be the next president and insist Trump concede.  Repeat this over dozens of states and this explains why Joe did not bother to go on the campaign trail at all. He knew it was in the bag.  American politics utterly stinks .

Noone is President Elect. The term ""President-Elect"" 1st observed in 20th amendment 1933. Jan 6th Congress counts electoral votes. 270 or more wins. Term President-Elect was then used but NOT until the 6th. If noone hits 270 the House picks President.

Reminds me of that scene in 1984
The best thing Biden did: he didn't mention Trump in a word
Plot twist: Joe Briben is not president-elect.
Biden tests negative for President
Look at all our new brothers and sisters....Amen

You know that Trump has lowered the bar when everyone in the comments is happy that Biden talks like an actual president and not like 5 year old.
You know that it’s a special day when you’re not even American and still got goosebumps when harris announced joe
"""I see no red states or blue states, only united states"", this is how a president talks!"
Bravo.......

And I'm usually the first to dog the way this country and it's many wonderful different races has become.. This made me hopeful for our future as humans and to hold my head high and be proud to be a free American in this huge beautiful country of ours🤯💯✌️"

What a farce
"If it were the President of my country, I would be worried ..."
I can't believe they elected the kiddy fondler. Damn...
"President elect Biden is forged with deeply painful life tragedies and rich political experiences in preparation to his toughest battle in leading a divided and fractured nation.

Reading his life story, I cannot help myself remembering the tiny book Profiles in Courage by JFK I read long ago. I imagine myself travelling back in time and find him amongst great leaders of not so distant past. Mr President, I have no doubt that the whole universe has conspired to help and put you in your exact place and cirscumstance."
"WOW, he speaks to trump supporters too ""let's give each other a chance""

 u will not hear that from Trump for sureee......"
Absolutely disgusting!
Mr. Joe biden congratulations for president of United States of America I hope help many more country cause of covid 19 pandemic

"Americans won't believe how often they were in the news in other countries because of the shit their president has said or done, I feel like I heard or read something almost every day, I'm glad this is finally over and people will respect your president again."
"You want global harmony and cooperation? GO METRIC, AMERICA. We've thrown a wrench in the machinery of humanity for too long."

Bad news for East Europe. Good news for Germany and Russia.
He is not president elect yet
If nothing else  America is getting a understanding of the election process according to the constitution and relative legal activity to such an event as we May see as a result of this recent election cycle. Ergo the founders had it figured out.

"Crying Like a baby. Thank you, democtats, to vote for a President thats human again! Lots of Love and congratulations from Europe!"
"Economics over Politics. Security over Military. Balance budget over negative budget. Adopt and execute all these policies diligently. Forget above “leading” the world again. The world need peace and security, not a leader."

"... given all the allogations and proof of voter fraud, computer voter software ""glitches"", dead people votes, vote tampering, etc... will the medias decision to elevate Biden to President Elect stick? Time will tell..."
What a speech !!! Ireland loves you too joe 🇮🇪💚

"The story of how Biden and Poroshenko for a billion dollars from Joe Biden fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who began to investigate the son of Joe Biden, hunter Biden, the youngest son of us Vice President Joe Biden, became a member of the Board of Directors of Burisma in April 2014 (it also included former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, a friend of the stepson of former Secretary of state John Kerry Devon Archer, and others). ... As part of the investigation into possible money laundering, the British authorities froze deposits in London banks for $23 million, which allegedly belonged to the owner of Burisma Zlochevsky. In Ukraine, a new scandal, and surprisingly not coronavirus. This week, the world finally saw and heard the documentary ... We found out who exactly and what Poroshenko paid a billion dollars for-this is Joe Biden and the entire Obama army."

"Joe Biden's not the president-elect, no amount of MSM lies will make it so! Not until all questions have been answered and election results are accepted...which they are not."
"Congratulations to America on President-elect Joe Biden & Kamala Harris from Northern Ireland.  It's time for the country to come together, my prayers go out to those infected with covid & those sadly lost."
The best präsident ever

This is what we need, Even with anything he said wrong or came off wrong in the past, I am willing to give Biden a chance before Trump anyday🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 A leader is not about being perfect, A leader is someone who has realized their mistakes however Know their potential to become greater and become that over time. Someone like Biden , Is the prefect example of that! He stands for morals, Leadership of his family and not just America and other countries. This man has standards and Determination! He learned a lot from Obama when he was vice president as well! The level of respect this man has earned, He has our full support!  Cant wait to witness greatness and meaningful effective changes Trump could never !!"
sleepy Joe hates blacks it will be hot
"The wheels are rolling. He's got new vigor and passion. Man, I sure hope he can keep this up for 4 years."
"Joe Biden says
salary = 50% of one worker produsability and < or = 5000 $  
min salary = ? you are rude"
As like as Obama
"And he said to God in his wise saying, and those who were killed for the sake of God do not count dead, but rather they are alive with their Lord and give to God. Every Muslim who defended his land, his family and his homeland says, we preach to him of his paradise. Judgment is not for you, the ruling is for God alone, there is no partner to him, so you belong to God who created you, and to God who kills you, but God will remain alive, and you are in the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful."
"dependent Turkey stayed in the past. Caatsa sanctions shave our beard. Turkey can cut your arm in the Middle East, Africa and Caucasus. You need to keep your good relations with Turkey."
Biden : Paris climate conclave here I come
He is not President elect. He has not been certified as such.
"Well spoken Biden, may you keep and stand by your words, the black community cannot wait for the chance to be an equal as you have promised. May America be a continued possibility."
All congratulations to President Trump-he will cleanse the planet from Satanists and pedophiles.

"``Der Opportunismus, die Lüge und das Kriechertum haben sich wieder einmal durchgesetzt. Die Amerikaner werden diese erneute Wahlfälschung mit tausenden toten GI`S bezahlen müssen. Bidens Grimasse sieht der vom Joker verdammt ähnlich  - Fate oder Fake?!"
From Italy I'm really happy...Trump was famous in italy only for memes and for stupid things that he said
"It must be so embarrassing for the media getting this one wrong, shows their true colours though. Can’t wait until trump wins, how are these idiots gonna lie their way out that idk."

, so once again, the media lie and lie and lie"
"I'm just waiting to watch the second chapter of drama where half of Americans who did not support Trump has been criticising against Trump for nearly 5 years and now Half of Americans who support Trump will be doing the same to the newly elected President.

Soooo cringe
"He is still not a president jet, just not jet. Wait till Dec. 14’s"
I love how he mentioned  his wife so thoughtfully  in his winning speech ❤️
Look deep down you are a sell out
"This victory is just the tonic that America needs at this time.
Joe Biden, in my opinion, is the ideal choice for President.
He has had his formal education for the requirements of the job working as VP under Obama. 
This man is honest and has the common touch. He is charismatic and speaks a language that we can understand and follow."
"Kamala  Harris 
I always prayed for peace in America and the world .
I really want to know abut your personality and philosophy . 
I want  to talk one to one .   And I think that day will come someday ."

This is not over yet... Who decided that Joe Biden is already the president-elect?  BBC?  CNN?
Joe Biden is a bad guy

Not the president-elect. Not the new president.  I don't think Gore even gave a speech so fast.   Maybe if Biden and Harris act like they won no one would notice that they didn't win.  Honest president-elect NOT.
How can you be president when they are still counting votes. So over this media bias
"Congrats to Biden, seriously, now he can spend 4 years of still not doing anything,just like the past 37 years."

Congratulations joe biden from the UK !!! The best man won and I'm glad Trump is out yes !!!!!!!
"You need to check out Dominion. This is the manufacturer of the computer on line counting machines in DEMOCRAT states. No they do not all use the same machines. But almost to a man democrat states use Dominion kit.  The big scam is, this company is owned by and run by family members of the most senior Democrats in the USA. The CEO is husband to the most senior Democrat.  (Google and Wikki fill in the blanks quite well) The shares are all owned by democrats. It was a Dominion machine that was  nudged into a quick transfer of votes, once discovered the cover story was ""Glitch"" however no one has any idea the true scale of the fraud ...  yet questions need answering. But first the why?  Well once you set off on the path of fraud you may as well do a good job. In the past basic fraud lead to 115% turn outs and more. So an issue. This lead to more covert sophistication. Live data. This then gave the ""thieves"" access to the numbers,  telling them how far behind they were, and more importantly how many votes  were needed without the alarm bells sounding fraud. .(the 115% issue)  This had to be carefully factored to avoid another 115% turn out issue.  You then need to plan how to collect and introduce additional ballots. Its starts back in May the cover story. You tell everyone on your side to use mail in voting because of fears of COVID 19. This was massively convenient and pushed by a compliant press. You argue and win publically a massive increase in mail in ballot voting. Next on election day via the live data feed (you made the machines and you get the data) someone calculates which states need an injection of ballots and how many..  These then are found. Don't forget the cover story is the post office is over whelmed and some will arrive late but all is well because of the post mark being proof of posting within the voting time limit. So the excuse is circulating before the event. Next you make sure any witnesses are kept well away from the vote counting and accept a little push back on this,  but none from the media of course. Then just in time hundreds of thousands of votes appear and save the day. Yet there are safe guards built into the ballot counting process to prevent fraud. That is the automatic signature comparison algorithm. The authenticated threshold is dumbed down from a 75 % probable match to a worthless 40%  Done without anyone knowing.    Then turning down the dot per inch resolution from the workable 200 DPI to 50 DPI ... The system then can never find fault with a signature. So all doubtful ballots even if signed by Donald Duck are accepted as valid.  This has added benefits. The election is close and believable !!!    Recently (yesterday) an affidavit from a postal worker surfaced, he was working on back dating ballots for that nights find. Then a Judge today confesses he was bribed back in May... He does not say quite what for. But it's nice if something is contested to have the judge on your side.  Next an honest judge insists by court order ""observers"" are allowed within 6 feet of the vote counters, this is ignored completely despite it being state law. The illegal votes are safely introduced. Joe Biden and the media say Joe will be the next president and insist Trump concede.  Repeat this over dozens of states and this explains why Joe did not bother to go on the campaign trail at all. He knew it was in the bag.  American politics utterly stinks ."
Fake news...election is not yet over

"Noone is President Elect. The term ""President-Elect"" 1st observed in 20th amendment 1933. Jan 6th Congress counts electoral votes. 270 or more wins. Term President-Elect was then used but NOT until the 6th. If noone hits 270 the House picks President."
This speech will be remembered for along time.

The first woman in the white House only got in by cheating.. Yeah great day for women.. You can't get in the right way.. You cheat! Great lesson for young women..
"I'm so ready to respect this country again. Glad you guys stood up for democracy and chose a worthy president. That was a speech of healing, of unison. Lets finally look towards the future. I'm not an american but i have tears in my eyes: we will not lead by the example of our power, but by the power of our example- thats presidential"
"This guy was one of the main reasons for the Iraq war 
Not because the bush administration deceived him....no,in his opinion it was a very good choice 
Americans are so naiv unfortunately!"
"Just a note from the UK, you now have a president that is in his soul a good man regardless of politics. The world needs this guy to bring some dignity back to democracy."
Can anyone explain why the video of him feeling kids up has been removed this is clearly a fix because he sold his soul to lobbyist who are now protecting him online laughable and anyone who disagree is just a shill plain and simple
I once respected the BBC...I once believed they had integrity and reported the news honestly. I now see that that was a mistake... Joe Biden is nothing more than former Vice President of the Obama Administration. The Associated Press does not declare our President Elect.
I am an indian but i am still here 🏳️ we love you sir 💌
